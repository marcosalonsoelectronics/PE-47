Files associated to video Power Electronics #47: Effect of EMI Filter on the Dynamic Response of DC-DC Converters

Available at: https://youtu.be/a6Zu8u7t1xc

In this video we study the effect of EMI filter on the dynamic response of a DC-DC converter. This is an important topic that is usually neglected in many basic courses on power electronics. The video shows how to obtain the control-to-output transfer function of a DC-DC converter including the effect of the EMI filter. Also, the effect on the stability of the converter in closed loop is studied. It is shown how the inclusion of the EMI filter can make unstable an originally stable closed-loop operated converter. Examples and simulations results are shown.
